## What is it?

The goal of this mod is to minimize the amount of time you spend in GUIs in Minecraft by effectively integrating interaction with them into the world.

You can use things such as the crafting table, furnaces, and brewing stands without having to open a GUI, and even more when you're in VR!

## VR?

There's VR support! You'll need my API mod, [mc-vr-api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mc-vr-api) to use this in VR. With this mod installed, you'll be able to use your actual hands to place items, instead of just right clicking!

## Status

This mod is currently a work in progress. There are available alpha builds, which you can grab from the [releases page](https://github.com/hammy3502/immersive-mc/releases)!
