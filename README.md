## What is it?

The goal of ImmersiveMC is to make Minecraft more immersive! It most obviously does this by minimizing the amount of GUIs you need to interact with.

You can use things such as the crafting table, furnaces, and brewing stands without having to open a GUI, and even more when you're in VR!

## VR?

There's VR support! In fact, this mod was primarily built to make VR a better experience!

You'll need my API mod, [mc-vr-api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mc-vr-api) to use this in VR. With this mod installed, you'll be able to use your actual hands to place items, instead of just right clicking!
