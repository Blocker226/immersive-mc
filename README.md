# immersive-mc

Makes Minecraft quite immersive!

## What is it?

The goal of this mod is to minimize the amount of time you spend in GUIs in Minecraft by effectively integrating interaction with them into the world.

## VR?

There is VR support! You'll need my API mod, [mc-vr-api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mc-vr-api) to use this in VR. With this mod installed, you'll be able to use your actual hands to place items, instead of just right clicking!

## Status

This mod is currently a work in progress. I might start doing alpha builds soon, but until then, no binaries will be distributed.
